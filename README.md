LExSDKv2
=========

![build status](https://github.com/d00telemental/LExSDKv2/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Foundation for building native mods for Mass Effect Legendary Edition trilogy.

Extends and improves prior iterations of the UE3 SDK, though the principle is the same.
These SDKs are imperfect projections of Unreal Engine's reflection system powering UnrealScript,
among many other subsystems.

## Credits

This project is designed around code auto-generated by an [adapted version](https://github.com/d00telemental/LExSDKGenerator)
of TheFeckless' UE3 SDK generator. None of this would be possible without their original work.
Additionally, this iteration incorporates the partial TMap implementation by SirCxyrtyx, with permission.

## License

No license is specified by this project because the absolute majority of its code is based on
information semi-automatically extracted from the Mass Effect Legendary Edition games or earlier
games built on Unreal Engine 3, and is thus indirectly built on code and assets belonging to Epic Games
and EA / BioWare.

In theory, this project is a modding tool and should fall in the same gray area that most game modding projects
belong to. In practice, I would prefer to avoid testing that theory.
